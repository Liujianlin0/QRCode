/// A qr code generator that uses QRCodeGenerator (https://github.com/dagronf/swift-qrcode-generator) as its generator.
/// This is primarily used for WatchOS, which doesn't support CoreImage filters.
///
/// The generator library (https://github.com/fwcd/swift-qrcode-generator) is not automatically imported into the
/// core QRCode module as some projects may not want to link against a 3rd party library for their
/// macOS/iOS or tvOS application.
///
/// By wrapping the 3rd party library in a separate Swift module it provides the flexibility to ignore it if you
/// don't need it.
